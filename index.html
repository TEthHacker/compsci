        <h2>Why did iclade this website?</h2>

        <p>
         There a simple explanation for that. Because i want teach you the things that 
          i learned from the Ethicla Course in a easy way. So i,could reorganise the information 
          to master the teaching, weiting and pof course hacking skills. ETHICALLY OF COURSE!:
        </p>

        <h3>What do i learn from the courses? </h3>

        <p>
          You're going to learn about how to ethically hack a system so you could find some vulerbakities
          These are like holes in the system. Make the system secure again. But the war doesn't there.
          Because black hat hackers are always finding a solution to bypass that security. We need as white hat hackers to make the systems secure so
          people could vrowse the web safely.
